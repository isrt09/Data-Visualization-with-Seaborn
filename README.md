# Data-Visualization-with-Seaborn
Seaborn is a data visualization library which provides a high-level interface to draw statistical graphs.  It is built on top of Pythonâ€™s core visualization library, Matplotlib. Seaborn extends the Matplotlib library for creating aesthetically pleasing graphs. Internally Seaborn uses Matplotlib to draw plots, so it complements the Matplotlib library but is not a replacement to it. Matplotlib is highly customizable, but it is hard to know what settings to tweak to render nice plots. Seaborn comes with a number of customized themes and a high-level interface for controlling the look of Matplotlib figures.
