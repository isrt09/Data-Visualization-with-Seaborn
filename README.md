# Data Visualization with Seaborn

Seaborn is a data visualization library which provides a high-level interface to draw statistical graphs.  It is built on top of Python’s core visualization library, Matplotlib. Seaborn extends the Matplotlib library for creating aesthetically pleasing graphs. Internally Seaborn uses Matplotlib to draw plots, so it complements the Matplotlib library but is not a replacement to it. 

Matplotlib is highly customizable, but it is hard to know what settings to tweak to render nice plots. Seaborn comes with a number of customized themes and a high-level interface for controlling the look of Matplotlib figures.   

Seaborn is an amazing data visualization library for statistical graphics plotting in Python. It provides beautiful default styles and colour palettes to make statistical plots more attractive. It is built on the top of the matplotlib library and also closely integrated to the data structures from pandas
